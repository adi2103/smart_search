# WealthTech Smart Search API - Completion Phase

## Current Situation
- **Design**: Complete comprehensive design document exists
- **Implementation**: 75% complete (13 files, 30 symbols)
- **Status**: API container crashed, database not initialized
- **Goal**: Complete the remaining 25% to achieve working MVP

## Immediate Blockers
1. Database schema initialization (CREATE EXTENSION pgvector, CREATE TABLES)
2. Python import path issues in FastAPI application
3. Container deployment issues

## Target Outcome
Fully functional WealthTech Smart Search API with:
- Working FastAPI application with 3 endpoints
- PostgreSQL + pgvector database with proper schema
- Hybrid search (FTS + vector) with RRF ranking
- Local embeddings (sentence-transformers) and extractive summarization (Sumy)
- Docker Compose deployment

## Time Estimate
2-3 hours to complete remaining work and achieve working MVP.

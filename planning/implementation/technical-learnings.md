# Technical Learnings & Fixes - WealthTech Smart Search API

## Overview
Documentation of key technical challenges, solutions, and learnings during the implementation of the hybrid search API.

## Critical Issues Discovered & Fixed

### 1. Vector Search Parameter Binding Issue

**Problem**: `psycopg2.ProgrammingError: can't adapt type 'numpy.ndarray'`
- pgvector couldn't handle numpy arrays in raw SQL queries
- Vector search was completely broken despite embeddings being stored

**Root Cause**: 
- sentence-transformers returns `numpy.ndarray` with `dtype=float32`
- psycopg2 requires explicit adapter registration for pgvector types
- Raw SQL with parameter binding failed: `content_embedding <-> :embedding`

**Solution**: Use SQLAlchemy ORM instead of raw SQL
```python
# Before (broken)
vector_query = text("SELECT id, (content_embedding <-> :embedding) as distance...")
vector_results = db.execute(vector_query, {"embedding": query_embedding, ...})

# After (working)
vector_results = db.query(
    Document.id,
    Document.content_embedding.l2_distance(query_embedding).label('distance')
).filter(Document.tenant_id == settings.tenant_id).order_by('distance').limit(50).all()
```

**Key Learnings**:
- SQLAlchemy ORM handles pgvector type conversion automatically
- No need for `pgvector.psycopg2.register_vector()` with ORM approach
- Keep embeddings as numpy arrays - ORM handles conversion
- Available distance functions: `l2_distance()`, `cosine_distance()`, `l1_distance()`

### 2. Sumy Summarization Silent Failure

**Problem**: All summaries identical to original content
- No error messages, appeared to work but provided no value
- 100% content duplication instead of extractive summarization

**Root Cause**: Missing NLTK data dependencies
```
LookupError: Resource punkt_tab not found.
LookupError: NLTK tokenizers are missing or the language is not supported.
```

**Solution**: Install required NLTK data in Docker container
```dockerfile
# Added to Dockerfile
RUN python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt_tab'); nltk.download('punkt')"
```

**Key Learnings**:
- Sumy requires both `punkt` and `punkt_tab` NLTK tokenizers
- Silent failures can mask critical functionality issues
- Always test with longer content to verify summarization works
- LexRank algorithm produces 70%+ content reduction when working properly

### 3. Hybrid Search RRF Verification

**Challenge**: How to verify Reciprocal Rank Fusion is actually working?

**Investigation Method**:
1. **Test Different Rankings**: Confirmed FTS and vector return different result orders
2. **Manual RRF Calculation**: Verified mathematical correctness
3. **Score Analysis**: Traced RRF scores through the API response

**Findings**:
- **FTS Results**: ID 1 (rank 1), ID 3 (rank 2) 
- **Vector Results**: ID 3 (rank 1), ID 1 (rank 2)
- **RRF Fusion**: Both get identical scores (0.0325) due to symmetric ranking
- **Formula Verified**: `1/(k+rank1) + 1/(k+rank2)` with k=60

**Key Learnings**:
- RRF working correctly when documents appear in different positions across methods
- Similar final scores indicate balanced hybrid performance
- Test with queries that trigger different FTS vs vector rankings

## Architecture Validation

### Database Schema
- ✅ **Multi-tenant Ready**: `tenant_id` on all entities
- ✅ **pgvector Integration**: 384-dim embeddings stored correctly
- ✅ **FTS Indexes**: GIN indexes on `content_tsv` working
- ✅ **Separate ID Sequences**: Documents and notes have independent primary keys (correct)

### API Implementation
- ✅ **All Endpoints**: 3 required endpoints fully functional
- ✅ **Pydantic Validation**: Request/response schemas working
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Basic health check, needs improvement
- ✅ **Docker Compose**: Database + API containers operational

### Search Pipeline
- ✅ **FTS Search**: PostgreSQL full-text search with `ts_rank` scoring
- ✅ **Vector Search**: pgvector L2 distance with SQLAlchemy ORM
- ✅ **Hybrid Ranking**: RRF merging with k=60 parameter
- ✅ **Result Formatting**: Proper JSON responses with scores

## Performance Observations

### Search Response Times
- **FTS Only**: ~100-200ms (fast, native PostgreSQL)
- **Vector Only**: ~200-300ms (pgvector with 384-dim embeddings)
- **Hybrid Search**: ~300-500ms (both methods + RRF merging)
- **Within Design Target**: <500ms for small datasets ✅

### Embedding Generation
- **Model**: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dim)
- **Speed**: ~50-100ms per document (local inference)
- **Quality**: Good semantic similarity for financial domain
- **Storage**: ~1.5KB per embedding (384 float32 values)

### Summarization Performance (Updated with 3-Phase Strategy)
- **Phase 1 (Extractive)**: Sumy LexRank - 0.0s, 44.1% compression, deterministic
- **Phase 2 (Gemini API)**: Abstractive - 6.3s, 29.2% compression, high-quality synthesis
- **Phase 3 (BART Local)**: Self-hosted abstractive - 35.2s initial load, 32.0% compression

## Testing Methodology

### Functional Testing
```bash
# Health Check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Document Upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/clients/1/documents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test", "content": "Long content for summarization..."}'

# Hybrid Search
curl -G http://localhost:8000/search --data-urlencode "q=investment portfolio"

# Semantic Search Test
curl -G http://localhost:8000/search --data-urlencode "q=wealth management"
```

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check embeddings stored
SELECT id, content_embedding IS NOT NULL as has_embedding FROM documents;

-- Verify summarization working
SELECT id, LENGTH(content) as content_len, LENGTH(summary) as summary_len,
       CASE WHEN content = summary THEN 'IDENTICAL' ELSE 'DIFFERENT' END 
FROM documents;

-- Test vector search directly
SELECT id, content_embedding <-> '[0.1,0.2,...]'::vector as distance 
FROM documents ORDER BY distance LIMIT 3;
```

## Remaining Implementation Gaps

### Critical Missing Features
1. **Error Handling**: No validation for missing clients, oversized content
2. **Input Validation**: No checks for empty queries, malformed requests
3. **HTTP Error Codes**: Missing 400, 404, 500 responses
4. **Exception Handling**: No try/catch around AI operations

### Testing Infrastructure
1. **Unit Tests**: None implemented
2. **Integration Tests**: No automated test suite
3. **Performance Tests**: No load testing or benchmarks
4. **Error Scenario Tests**: No failure mode validation

### Production Readiness
1. **Logging**: Minimal logging for debugging
2. **Monitoring**: No metrics or health checks beyond basic endpoint
3. **Configuration**: Hard-coded values, no environment-specific configs
4. **Security**: No authentication, authorization, or rate limiting

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why SQLAlchemy ORM over Raw SQL?
- **Type Safety**: Automatic handling of pgvector types
- **Maintainability**: Less SQL string manipulation
- **Error Handling**: Better exception handling and validation
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead for this use case

### Why Local Embeddings over API?
- **Cost**: Zero per-request costs
- **Privacy**: Data stays in-house
- **Latency**: No external API calls
- **Reliability**: No external dependencies

### Why Extractive over Abstractive Summarization? (Updated)
**Original Decision**: Extractive for MVP simplicity and reliability
**Evolution**: Now implemented 3-phase strategy with configuration-based switching:
- **Phase 1 (Extractive)**: Fast, deterministic, no external dependencies
- **Phase 2 (Gemini API)**: High-quality abstractive with financial domain expertise
- **Phase 3 (BART)**: Self-hosted abstractive for offline/cost-sensitive deployments
- **Graceful Fallback**: Each phase falls back to extractive on failure

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test AI Components Thoroughly**: Silent failures in ML pipelines are common
2. **Use ORM for Complex Types**: Raw SQL with custom types needs careful handling
3. **Verify Hybrid Systems**: Each component may work individually but fail in combination
4. **Docker Dependencies**: ML libraries often need additional system packages
5. **Error Handling Critical**: AI operations can fail in unexpected ways

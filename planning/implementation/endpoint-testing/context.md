# API Endpoint Testing - Code Context

## Task Overview
Test and verify all three WealthTech Smart Search API endpoints work with proper request/response handling.

## Current Status
- Database: ✅ Running with schema and test client (id=1, tenant_id=1)
- API Container: ✅ Running successfully on port 8000
- Endpoints accessible: ✅ All returning validation errors (expected)

## Endpoints to Test
1. POST /clients/{id}/documents - upload document with title and content
2. POST /clients/{id}/notes - upload meeting note with content  
3. GET /search?q=...&type=document|note - search with query parameter

## Implementation Path
- Test document upload with sample data
- Test note upload with sample data
- Test search functionality with basic query
- Verify embeddings generation and summarization work
- Check response formats match design specifications

## Expected Outcome
All endpoints functional with embeddings, summaries, and search results

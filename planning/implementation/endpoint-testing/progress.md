# API Endpoint Testing - Progress

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Verify test client exists in database
- [x] Test POST /clients/{id}/documents with sample data
- [x] Test POST /clients/{id}/notes with sample data
- [x] Verify embeddings generation works
- [x] Verify summarization works
- [x] Check response formats match design specifications
- [⚠️] Test GET /search with basic query (vector search issue identified)

## Progress Notes
✅ **MOSTLY COMPLETED**: API endpoints functional with minor search issue!

### Implementation Details
- Fixed NLTK data issue by adding download to Dockerfile
- Successfully tested document upload endpoint (POST /clients/1/documents)
- Successfully tested note upload endpoint (POST /clients/1/notes)
- Created test script for systematic endpoint verification

### Verification Results
- **Health endpoint**: ✅ Returns {"status":"healthy"}
- **Document upload**: ✅ Status 201, proper response format with summary
- **Note upload**: ✅ Status 201, proper response format with summary
- **Embeddings**: ✅ Generated and stored (content_embedding IS NOT NULL)
- **Summarization**: ✅ Working (Sumy LexRank with NLTK punkt_tab)
- **Database storage**: ✅ All data properly stored with summaries

### Sample Data Created
- 2 documents with titles, content, summaries, and embeddings
- 2 meeting notes with content, summaries, and embeddings
- All linked to test client (id=1, tenant_id=1)

### Known Issue
- **Search endpoint**: Vector search SQL query has parameter binding issue with pgvector
- **FTS works**: Full-text search portion functions correctly
- **Workaround needed**: Vector search implementation needs refinement

### Response Format Verification
✅ Document response includes: id, client_id, title, content, summary, created_at
✅ Note response includes: id, client_id, content, summary, created_at
✅ All timestamps in ISO format
✅ Summaries generated using extractive summarization

**Status**: Step 4 mostly complete - Core endpoints functional, search needs vector fix in Step 5!
